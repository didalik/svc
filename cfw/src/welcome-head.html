    <h1>&#x1f477;Shared Services Example</h1>
    <p>Hi there, I'm Дід Alik - the founder of <i>Дід Alik and the Kids</i> distributed organization. The org's specialty is automated integration modeling, and presently we have three projects to work on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Stellar Help Exchange</b>, opening the globally equitable marketplace on Stellar Network;</li>
      <li><b>Role-Based Organizations on Git Submodules</b>, governing the org and helping others govern themselves; and</li>
      <li><b>Shared Services</b>, enabling all of the above and much more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This site is a shared service example. Here, you can communicate with others via HTTPS and/or with a remote host via SSH. Please check it out and, should you like it, <a href="mailto:didalik.aim@gmail.com">join us</a>!</p>
