    <h2>&#x1f477;Securely Shared Cloud-Based Services: An Example</h2>
    <p>Hi there, I'm Дід Alik - the founder of <i>Дід Alik and the Kids</i> distributed organization. The org's specialty is automated integration modeling, and presently I have three cloud-based projects for you to join:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Stellar Help Exchange</b>, opening the globally equitable marketplace on Stellar Network;</li>
      <li><b>Role-Based Organizations on Git Submodules</b>, governing the org and helping others govern themselves; and</li>
      <li><b><a href='https://github.com/didalik/svc'>Securely Shared Services</a></b>, enabling all of the above and much more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This site is an example of such a service. Here you securely communicate with others via HTTPS and with a remote host via SSH. Please check it out and, should you like it, <a href="mailto:didalik.aim@gmail.com">join me</a>!</p>
    <button id='buttonContinue'>Continue</button>
    <div id='divContinue' style='display: none'>
      <p>Your current geolocation is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>latitude XXX</li>
        <li>longitude XXX</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Press the button below to share it with other users of this site. You will receive their geolocations in response. Two more windows will pop up - please allow this. The first window monitors the websocket traffic between you and the site. The second window shows the geolocations of the users.</p>
      <button id='buttonShare'>Share</button>
      <p>Big deal, you may say. Google has it, others have it. Right. And now I have it too. All my ongoing cloud-based projects are based on this implementation. You can have it too - just ask!</p>
